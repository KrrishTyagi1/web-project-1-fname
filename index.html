        <br />
        <p>
          <u>
            Lebron is the goat because of how he plays the game and how well he
            can make whatever team he is on play better. He can take a bucnh of
            randoms to the fianl which no other NBA can do. And his longevity
            which when compared to any other athalete he is the best. he is also
            almost top 10 in every stat an No 1. in all time points there is

            Why do I have Michael Jordon as the second best player of all time?
          </b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <u>
            Michael Jordon made the game of basketball more popular. Many good
            players of this era grew up watching players like MJ, including
            Lebron James. The reason I don't have MJ as the goat is beacuse he
            could not make it past the first round without another HOF player
            unlike Lebron.

            Why do I have Thanasis Antetokounmpo as the third best player of all
            time?

        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          <u>
            The reason I have Thanasis Antetokounmpo as the third best player of
            all time is beacuse he is the brother of Giannis who is a MVP, and a
            NBA finals champion and a has a finals MVP. He also has about 500
            points which is really good for playing only for 6 seasons.

            Why do I have Bronny James Jr as the forth best player of all time?

        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          <u>
            The reason I have Bronny James Jr as the forth best player of all
            time is becasue he is the son of Lebron James and he also dropped 17
            points on Giannis Antetokounmpo and crossed him up. I will have a
            link to that so you can see for urself he also plays for the Los
            Angeles Lakers which is argubaly the best team in the league. So
            playing for them is difficut.

            Why do I have Steph Curry as the Fifth best player of all time?

        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          <u>
            The reason I have Steph Curry as the Fifth best player of all time
            is becasue how good he can shoot the three ball he is the all time
            leading 3pts leader of all time which a record I think is impossible
            to break while doing on a really good Field Goal percentage. Steph
            Curry also has 4 rings a final MVP and is the first NBA player of
            all time to get a unanimous Mvp.
