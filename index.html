        <b> Why do I have lebron as the goat? </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>
          Lebron is the goat because of how he plays the game and how well he
          can make whatever team he is on play better. He can take a bucnh of
          randoms to the fianl which no other NBA can do. And his longevity
          which when compared to any other athalete he is the best. he is also
          almost top 10 in every stat an No 1. in all time points there is

        <b>
          Why do I have Michael Jordon as the second best player of all time?
        </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>
          Michael Jordon made the game of basketball more popular. Many good
          players of this era grew up watching players like MJ, including Lebron
          James. The reason I don't have MJ as the goat is beacuse he could not
          make it past the first round without another HOF player unlike Lebron.

        <b>
          Why do I have Thanasis Antetokounmpo as the third best player of all
          time?
        </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>
          The reason I have Thanasis Antetokounmpo as the third best player of
          all time is beacuse he is the brother of Giannis who is a MVP, and a
          NBA finals champion and a has a finals MVP. He also has about 500
          points which is really good for playing only for 6 seasons.
        </u>

        <b>
          Why do I have Bronny James Jr as the forth best player of all time?
        </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          <u>
            The reason I have Bronny James Jr as the forth best player of all time
            is becasue he is the son of Lebron James and he also dropped 17 points
            on Giannis Antetokounmpo and crossed him up. I will have a link to
            that so you can see for urself he also plays for the Los Angeles
            Lakers which is argubaly the best team in the league. So playing for
            them is difficut.

        <b> Why do I have Steph Curry as the Fifth best player of all time? </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <u>
          The reason I have Steph Curry as the Fifth best player of all time is
          becasue how good he can shoot the three ball he is the all time
          leading 3pts leader of all time which a record I think is impossible
          to break while doing on a really good Field Goal percentage. Steph
          Curry also has 4 rings a final MVP and is the first NBA player of all
          time to get a unanimous Mvp.
